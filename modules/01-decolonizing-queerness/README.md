# Module 01: Decolonizing Queerness

This module challenges the colonial and Western frameworks that have historically defined queerness. It excavates pre‑colonial histories of same‑sex desire and gender variance, critiques the “global gay” paradigm that exports a narrow, white, Western model of LGBT identity, and foregrounds indigenous and non‑Western categories that resist binary logics.

## Key Themes

*   **Pre‑colonial sexualities:** How same‑sex desire and gender variance were understood and organized before European colonization.
*   **Colonial legacies:** The imposition of sodomy laws and the creation of the “homosexual” as a pathological category.
*   **Critiques of the “global gay”:** The neoliberal export of Western LGBT rights as a form of cultural imperialism.
*   **Indigenous and non‑Western categories:** Two‑Spirit, hijra, muxe, fa’afafine, and other gender/sexual formations that exceed the LGBT framework.
*   **Queer of color critique:** Theorizing the intersections of race, sexuality, and empire.

## Discussion Questions (Sample)

1.  How did colonial legal systems actively produce the categories of “homosexual” and “heterosexual” in the societies they colonized?
2.  What is lost when local, non‑Western forms of same‑sex desire are forced into the Western LGBT identity model?
3.  In what ways do indigenous gender/sexual categories challenge the binary logic of Western gender and sexuality?
4.  How can queer of color critique help us understand the double bind of being simultaneously hyper‑visible as a “problem” and invisible as a subject?
