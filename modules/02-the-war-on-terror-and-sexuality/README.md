# Module 02: The War on Terror and Sexuality

This module examines how sexuality has been weaponized in the context of the “War on Terror.” It analyzes the use of homosexuality as a tool of torture and humiliation (e.g., at Abu Ghraib), the construction of the “homophobic Muslim” as a foil for the “liberal West,” and the complex realities of queer life and resistance in conflict zones. The module critiques the imperialist deployment of LGBT rights as a justification for intervention and occupation.

## Key Themes

*   **Sexual torture and humiliation:** How homosexuality was staged as a form of psychological warfare in detention sites like Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo.
*   **The “homophobic Muslim” vs. “liberal West” binary:** How this dichotomy serves to justify military intervention, Islamophobia, and the “saving” of queer Muslims.
*   **Queer refugee and asylum politics:** The limitations and colonial hierarchies embedded in the asylum system for queer people fleeing persecution.
*   **Queer resistance in conflict zones:** How queer activists in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Palestine navigate survival, solidarity, and resistance to both imperialism and fundamentalism.
*   **Homonationalism and the War on Terror:** How certain Western nations frame themselves as LGBT‑friendly to legitimize militarized violence against “backward” others.

2.  How does the narrative of “saving” queer Muslims from their “homophobic” societies serve to justify military intervention and Islamophobia?
3.  What are the limitations of the asylum system for queer refugees, and how does it often reinforce colonial hierarchies?
