# Jasbir Puar, *Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times* (2007)

## Critical Introduction

Jasbir Puar’s *Terrorist Assemblages* is a landmark intervention that fundamentally reshapes how we understand the intersections of sexuality, race, and empire in the post‑9/11 era. Puar introduces the concept of **homonationalism**—the process by which certain Western nation‑states (most notably the United States and Israel) incorporate LGBT rights into their national self‑image as a marker of modernity, tolerance, and civilization. This incorporation, however, is not a simple victory for queer liberation; rather, it is a strategic tool used to justify racism, Islamophobia, imperial warfare, and settler colonialism. The “homonationalist” state presents itself as the protector of gay rights against a supposedly “homophobic” Muslim world, thereby reinforcing the “War on Terror” binary that pits a “liberal, gay‑friendly West” against a “backward, violent Islam.”

Puar’s analysis is particularly crucial for anti‑imperialist queer critique because it exposes the **double bind** faced by queer Muslims and queer people of color. On one hand, they are targeted by homophobic violence within their own communities; on the other, they are objectified by Western “rescue” narratives that instrumentalize their suffering to legitimize military intervention, surveillance, and torture (as seen in the Abu Ghraib photographs where homosexuality was staged as a form of humiliation). Puar shows how the figure of the “homophobic Muslim” becomes a convenient foil that allows Western states to pose as progressive while escalating militarized violence abroad and reinforcing racist immigration and asylum policies at home.

*Terrorist Assemblages* also challenges the liberal assumption that LGBT rights movements are inherently progressive. Puar demonstrates how mainstream gay and lesbian activism in the Global North often embraces nationalist, xenophobic, and imperialist agendas—a phenomenon she terms “homonationalism.” This critique is essential for dismantling the **liberal savior complex** that frames Western LGBT activism as a model for the rest of the world and ignores the ways in which that model is entangled with colonial and imperial power.

## Discussion Questions

1.  **Defining Homonationalism:** How does Puar define “homonationalism,” and what historical and political conditions does she argue produced this phenomenon? How does the concept help us understand the relationship between LGBT rights and the “War on Terror”?

2.  **The “Homophobic Muslim” Trope:** In what ways does the figure of the “homophobic Muslim” serve to justify both Islamophobia and imperial intervention? How does this trope obscure the complexities of queer life and resistance in Muslim‑majority societies?

3.  **Critiquing Liberal Gay Politics:** Puar argues that mainstream Western LGBT movements are often complicit with nationalism, militarism, and settler colonialism. Provide at least two examples from the book (or from contemporary politics) that illustrate this complicity. How does this challenge the idea that LGBT rights are inherently progressive?

4.  **Double Bind and Resistance:** How does Puar’s analysis illuminate the “double struggle” of queer Muslims and queer people of color—caught between homophobic violence in their own communities and the racist, imperialist “rescue” narratives of the West? What forms of resistance does Puar suggest or imply are possible?

5.  **Contemporary Relevance:** Identify a current example of homonationalism in state or corporate rhetoric (e.g., a government’s “LGBT‑friendly” branding, a corporation’s rainbow‑washing campaign). How does this example align with or differ from Puar’s 2007 analysis? Have the logics of homonationalism evolved in the past decade?
