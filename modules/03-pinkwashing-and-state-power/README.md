# Module 03: Pinkwashing and State Power

This module investigates the phenomenon of “pinkwashing”—the use of LGBT‑friendly imagery by states and corporations to mask human‑rights abuses, occupation, militarism, and apartheid. It focuses on cases such as Israel’s “Brand Israel” campaign, US diplomatic rhetoric, and corporate “rainbow capitalism.” The module also highlights queer anti‑occupation movements that challenge both pinkwashing and the homonationalism of Western gay movements.

## Key Themes

*   **Pinkwashing defined:** How states deploy LGBT‑friendly rhetoric and imagery to distract from or legitimize violence, occupation, and apartheid.
*   **Homonationalism:** The convergence of LGBT rights with nationalist and imperialist agendas, often framed as a marker of Western “civilization.”
*   **Corporate rainbow capitalism:** The commodification of queer identity by multinational corporations, often alongside exploitative labor practices in the Global South.
*   **Queer anti‑occupation activism:** The work of queer Palestinian, anti‑settler colonial, and other movements that refuse pinkwashing and build solidarity across struggles.
*   **Intersectional critiques:** How pinkwashing intersects with other forms of “washing” (greenwashing, sportswashing) and with broader systems of racial capitalism.
