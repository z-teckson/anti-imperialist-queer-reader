# Anti-Imperialist Queer Activism: A Critical Reader – Syllabus

## Course Overview

This digital reader is organized as a semester-long syllabus for advanced undergraduate or graduate students in critical gender and sexuality studies, post‑colonial theory, and human rights. It can be adapted for shorter modules or self‑directed study.

Each module pairs foundational theoretical texts with contemporary case studies, all filtered through an explicit anti‑imperialist lens. The goal is to equip students with the analytical tools to:

*   Deconstruct Western liberal narratives of “saving” queer people in the Global South.
*   Trace the historical and ongoing entanglement of sexuality with colonial, imperial, and militarized power.
*   Center the resistance strategies and intellectual production of queer activists from the Global South.
*   Imagine transnational solidarities that do not reproduce colonial hierarchies.

## Module 01: Decolonizing Queerness

**Key Themes:** Pre‑colonial sexualities; the invention of “sodomy” as a colonial crime; critiques of the “global gay” and LGBT rights export; indigenous gender/sexual categories (e.g., Two‑Spirit, hijra, muxe, etc.); queer of color critique.

### Curated Texts

*   *[Placeholder]* – Introduction to the module: “What Does It Mean to Decolonize Queerness?”
*   *[Placeholder]* – Excerpt from **Marc Epprecht**, *Hungochani: The History of a Dissident Sexuality in Southern Africa*.
*   *[Placeholder]* – **Jasbir Puar**, “Queer Times, Queer Assemblages” (from *Terrorist Assemblages*).
*   *[Placeholder]* – **M. Jacqui Alexander**, “Not Just (Any) Body Can Be a Citizen: The Politics of Law, Sexuality and Postcoloniality in Trinidad and Tobago.”

### Discussion Questions

1.  How did colonial legal systems (e.g., British sodomy laws, French penal codes) create the very categories of “homosexual” and “heterosexual” in colonized societies?
2.  What is the “global gay” paradigm, and how does it erase local, non‑Western forms of same‑sex desire and gender variance?
3.  In what ways do indigenous gender/sexual categories challenge the binary logic of Western LGBT identity politics?
4.  How can queer of color critique help us understand the double bind of being simultaneously hyper‑visible as a “problem” and invisible as a subject?

## Module 02: The War on Terror and Sexuality

**Key Themes:** Homosexuality as a tool of torture (Abu Ghraib, Guantánamo); the “homophobic Muslim” vs. “liberal West” binary; queer refugee and asylum politics; queer resistance in conflict zones (e.g., Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan).

### Curated Texts

*   *[Placeholder]* – Introduction to the module: “Sexual Torture and the Imperial Gaze.”
*   *[Placeholder]* – **Jasbir Puar & Amit Rai**, “Monster, Terrorist, Fag: The War on Terrorism and the Production of Docile Patriots.”
*   *[Placeholder]* – **Saʻed Atshan**, “The Paradox of LGBT Rights in the West Bank and Gaza.”
*   *[Placeholder]* – **Nadje Al‑Ali**, “Sexual Violence in Iraq: Challenges for Transnational Feminist Solidarity.”

### Discussion Questions

1.  Analyze the photographs from Abu Ghraib: how was homosexuality staged as a form of humiliation, and what does this reveal about the racialized and sexualized logics of the War on Terror?
2.  How does the narrative of “saving” queer Muslims from their “homophobic” societies serve to justify military intervention and Islamophobia?
3.  What are the limitations of the asylum system for queer refugees, and how does it often reinforce colonial hierarchies?
4.  How do queer activists in conflict zones navigate the competing demands of local survival, transnational solidarity, and resistance to both imperialism and fundamentalism?

## Module 03: Pinkwashing and State Power

**Key Themes:** State‑sponsored LGBT‑friendly imagery (Israel’s “Brand Israel,” US diplomacy); corporate rainbow capitalism; the intersection of pinkwashing with settler colonialism, apartheid, and militarism; queer anti‑occupation movements.

### Curated Texts

*   *[Placeholder]* – Introduction to the module: “Pinkwashing: When LGBT Rights Become a Propaganda Tool.”
*   *[Placeholder]* – **Jasbir Puar**, “The ‘Right’ to Maim: Debility, Capacity, Disability” (from *The Right to Maim*).
*   *[Placeholder]* – **Sarah Schulman**, “Israel/Palestine and the Queer International.”
*   *[Placeholder]* – **Aeyal Gross**, “The Politics of LGBT Rights in Israel and Beyond: A New Chapter in the History of Human Rights?”

### Discussion Questions

1.  Define “pinkwashing” and give at least two concrete examples of how states use LGBT‑friendly imagery to distract from human‑rights abuses.
2.  How does pinkwashing intersect with other forms of “washing” (e.g., greenwashing, sportswashing) in the service of state legitimacy?
3.  What are the ethical dilemmas for Western LGBT activists who are invited to tour Israel or other states engaged in pinkwashing campaigns?
4.  How do queer Palestinian and anti‑occupation activists challenge both Israeli pinkwashing and the homonationalism of Western gay movements?

## Assessment & Activities

*   **Weekly Reading Responses:** Students write 500‑word critical reflections connecting the assigned texts to contemporary news or activist campaigns.
*   **Collaborative Annotation:** Using Hypothesis or a similar tool, students collectively annotate the digital reader, adding supplementary sources, critiques, and personal reflections.
*   **Final Project:** Students produce either a traditional research paper **or** a creative activist output (e.g., a zine, a podcast episode, a lesson plan) that applies the reader’s framework to a specific case study of their choice.
