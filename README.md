# Anti-Imperialist Queer Activism: A Critical Reader

## Mission Statement

This collaborative digital reader is a radical pedagogical tool designed to challenge Western liberal savior narratives and foreground the voices, theories, and resistance strategies of queer activists and scholars from the Global South. We explicitly reject the instrumentalization of LGBT rights as a pretext for imperialist intervention, military occupation, and cultural domination. Instead, this reader centers the **double struggle** faced by queer people in the Global South: persecution from local conservative forces **and** co‑optation by neo‑colonial “human rights” discourses that serve imperial agendas.

## Core Principles

1.  **Decolonizing Queer Knowledge:** We prioritize texts that emerge from the lived experiences and intellectual labor of queer communities in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and other post‑colonial regions.
2.  **Anti‑Imperialist Critique:** Every selection must engage with the intersections of sexuality, race, class, and empire. We examine how homosexuality has been weaponized (e.g., in the War on Terror) and how “pinkwashing” is used to legitimize state violence.
3.  **Collaborative Curation:** This reader is built collectively, using GitHub’s version‑control and peer‑review tools. Contributions are vetted through a critical, anti‑imperialist lens.
4.  **Pedagogical Praxis:** Each module includes discussion questions that push students to connect theory with contemporary struggles and to imagine solidarity that does not reproduce colonial power dynamics.

## How to Use This Reader

*   **Instructors:** Adopt the reader as a primary or supplementary text for courses in Gender & Sexuality Studies, Post‑colonial Studies, Critical International Relations, or Human Rights.
*   **Students & Activists:** Read the modules in order or jump to themes that resonate with your work. Use the discussion questions for self‑study or group dialogue.
*   **Contributors:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on proposing new texts, writing critical introductions, and submitting pull requests.

## Structure

The reader is organized into thematic modules:

*   **Module 01: Decolonizing Queerness** – Histories of same‑sex desire before colonialism; critiques of the “global gay” paradigm; indigenous and non‑Western gender/sexual categories.
*   **Module 02: The War on Terror and Sexuality** – How homosexuality was used as a tool of torture and propaganda; the construction of the “homophobic Muslim” vs. the “liberal West”; queer resistance in conflict zones.
*   **Module 03: Pinkwashing and State Power** – How states (e.g., Israel, the US) deploy LGBT‑friendly imagery to mask occupation, militarism, and apartheid; corporate “rainbow capitalism” and its imperial logics.

Each module contains:
*   A **curated list of key texts** (articles, book chapters, manifestos, documentaries)
*   **Critical introductions** that frame the texts within our anti‑imperialist framework
*   **Discussion questions** for classroom or activist use
