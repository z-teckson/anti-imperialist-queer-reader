# Contributing to the Anti‑Imperialist Queer Reader

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this collaborative project. Our goal is to build a critical, anti‑imperialist resource that centers the voices of queer activists and scholars from the Global South. To ensure that every contribution aligns with this mission, we ask that you follow the guidelines below.

## 1. Thematic & Political Guidelines

### What We Are Looking For
*   **Texts by authors from the Global South** that analyze the intersections of sexuality, race, class, and empire.
*   **Critiques of Western liberal savior narratives** and the instrumentalization of LGBT rights for imperial purposes.
*   **Analyses of pinkwashing, homonationalism, and the weaponization of homosexuality** in contexts such as the War on Terror, settler colonialism, or corporate rainbow capitalism.
*   **First‑person accounts, manifestos, and activist writings** from queer communities resisting both local persecution and imperial co‑optation.
*   **Historical and pre‑colonial perspectives** on same‑sex desire and gender variance that challenge the “global gay” paradigm.

### What We Are *Not* Looking For
*   Texts that uncritically celebrate Western LGBT rights movements as a model for the rest of the world.
*   Contributions that reinforce the “homophobic Global South vs. liberal West” binary.
*   Work that ignores or dismisses the agency and intellectual production of queer people in the Global South.
*   Pieces that treat “queer” as a synonym for “white, Western, and middle‑class.”

## 2. Contribution Workflow

### Step 1: Propose a Text (Issue)
1.  Open a new Issue in this repository.
2.  Title it: **“Proposal: Add [Title] by [Author]”**.
3.  In the issue body, provide:
    *   A **brief summary** of the text (approx. 150 words).
    *   A **link to the source** (if publicly available) or a full citation.
    *   A **strong justification** explaining why this text belongs in the reader and which module it fits into (Decolonizing Queerness, War on Terror & Sexuality, Pinkwashing & State Power, or a proposed new module).
    *   Suggested **discussion questions** (2‑3 questions) that could accompany the text.
4.  Apply the label **`content‑proposal`** (if available) and any other relevant labels (e.g., `module‑01`, `module‑02`, `module‑03`).

### Step 2: Discussion & Approval
*   Other contributors will comment on the issue, offering feedback, raising concerns, or suggesting alternative texts.
*   At least one maintainer must approve the proposal before moving to the next step. Approval is based on alignment with the project’s political guidelines and the quality of the justification.

### Step 3: Write the Critical Introduction (Pull Request)
1.  **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main` (e.g., `add‑text‑on‑pinkwashing`).
2.  Navigate to the appropriate module directory under `modules/` (create a new subdirectory if needed).
3.  Create a new markdown file named after the text (e.g., `puar‑homonationalism.md`).
4.  The file must contain:
    *   **A critical introduction** (approx. 300 words) that:
        *   Summarizes the text’s main arguments.
        *   Explicitly frames it within the reader’s anti‑imperialist, decolonial framework.
        *   Highlights how the text challenges Western liberal savior narratives.
        *   Connects the text to other readings in the module and to contemporary struggles.
    *   **3‑5 discussion questions** that push readers to think critically about imperialism, local context, and resistance.
    *   **A citation block** with full bibliographic details and, if possible, a link to an open‑access version.
5.  Commit your changes and push the branch to your fork.

### Step 4: Submit a Pull Request
1.  Open a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch of this repository.
2.  In the PR description, reference the original Issue number (e.g., “Closes #17”).
3.  Explain any editorial choices you made in your introduction and note any open questions you’d like reviewers to consider.

### Step 5: Peer Review
*   Maintainers and other contributors will review the PR, leaving inline comments on the markdown file.
*   Reviewers will focus on:
    *   **Political clarity:** Does the introduction avoid liberal savior tropes? Does it center the Global South?
    *   **Analytical depth:** Does the framing adequately critique imperialist and colonial logics?
    *   **Pedagogical usefulness:** Are the discussion questions provocative and relevant?
    *   **Stylistic consistency:** Is the writing accessible yet rigorous?
*   The PR author is expected to respond to comments, make revisions, and push new commits until the reviewers approve.

### Step 6: Merge and Update
*   Once the PR is approved, a maintainer will merge it (preferably using “squash and merge” to keep history clean).
*   The maintainer will then update the `SYLLABUS.md` file to include a link to the new text under the appropriate module.
*   The contributor will be credited in the commit history and, if desired, in a dedicated “Contributors” section of the README.

## 3. Style & Formatting

*   Use **Markdown** syntax for all files.
*   Write in clear, academic‑yet‑accessible prose. Avoid jargon unless it is clearly defined.
*   Use inclusive, non‑essentialist language (e.g., “queer people in the Global South” rather than “the queer community”).
*   Cite sources using a consistent citation style (we recommend **Chicago author‑date**).
*   For non‑English texts, provide the original title and, if possible, an English translation. Indicate if the translation is your own.
